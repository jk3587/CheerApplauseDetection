00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
I have the pleasure to present to you
dr. Martin Luther King

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:23.800
I'm happy to join with you today in what
will go down in history as the greatest

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:42.510
demonstration for freedom in the history
of our nation.  Five score years ago a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:52.119
great American in whose symbolic shadow
we stand today signed the Emancipation

00:00:52.119 --> 00:01:01.150
Proclamation this momentous decree came
as a great beacon light of hope to

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.049
millions of Negro slaves who had been
seared in the flames of withering

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:20.429
injustice it came as a joyous daybreak
to end the long night of their captivity

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:36.549
but 100 years later the Negro still is
not free one hundred years later the

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.819
life of the Negro is still sadly
crippled by the manacles of segregation

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:51.670
and the chains of discrimination 100
years later the Negro lives on a lonely

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:02.590
island of poverty I have
but one day this nation will rise up

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.890
live out the true meaning of its Creed
we always choose to be self-evident that

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:20.709
all men are created

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:35.410
I have a dream sons of former slaves and
the sons of former slave on will be able

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.710
to sit down together at the table of
brotherhood I have a dream that one day

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:50.880
even the state of Mississippi a state
sweltering with the heat of injustice

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.350
sweltering with the heat of oppression
be transformed into an oasis of freedom

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:10.060
and justice I have a dream my little
children will one day live in a nation

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.590
where they will not be judged by the
color of their skin but by the content

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.810
of their character I have agreed

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:34.790
dream that one day down in Alabama with
its vicious racists with its governor

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.439
having his lips dripping with the words
of interposition and nullification

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.750
little black boys and black girls will
be able to join hands with little white

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.769
boys and white girls

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.010
they're revealing mountain shall be made
low the rough places will be made plain

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:27.340
and the crooked places will be made with
this faith we will be able to hew out of

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.840
the mountain of despair of soul with
this faith we will be able to transform

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.750
the jangling discords of our nation into
a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.520
this faith we will be able to work
together to pray together to struggle

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.930
together to go to jail together to stand
up for freedom together

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:08.839
we'll be able to sing with new meaning
my country tis of thee sweet land of

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:14.749
liberty of thee I sing land where my
fathers died land of the pilgrims pride

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:21.729
from every mountainside let freedom ring
and of America's to be a great nation

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.529
this must become true
so let's freedom ring from the

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:33.169
prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire let
freedom ring from the mighty mountains

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.429
of New York let freedom ring from the
heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:45.679
let freedom ring from the snow-capped
Rockies of Colorado let freedom ring

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:52.669
from the curvaceous slopes of California
but not on to that let freedom ring from

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.750
Stone Mountain of Georgia
let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.870
of Tennessee
let freedom ring from every Hill

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.470
from every state and every city we will
be able to speed up that day when all of

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.380
God's children black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles Protestants and

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.750
Catholics will be able to join hands and
sing in the words of the old Negro

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:47.850
spiritual free at last
